## Unless you opt out, you will remain in this system as it is proposed even if you change your mind

## Doctors do not utilise the system as it is not fit for purpose for what they deliver

## Your doctor will still use their local digital records which are much more secure

## The more information in a database that can be accessed remotely, the greater the risk of attacks

## Even the most secure system can be exploited
