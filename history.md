## HISTORY

## My Health was introduced under a different name in 2012, it was opt-in, and voluntary, and few people elected to be in the system. In 2015, after market consultation, the government decided it wanted to use the information in My Health for secondary purposes, and proposed the forthcoming opt-out system.

## These secondary purposes are ostensibly for researcch and analytics involving data mining the health records of every Australian.
