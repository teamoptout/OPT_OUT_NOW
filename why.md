## Why opt out? You have no control over YOUR data in this system once you are in it, it will be a treasure troe of information for hackers advertisers and social engineering frims that will be highly sought after and cannot be guaranteed to be protected. Take for example Imogen's* regular iron, vitamin B12 and vitamin D checks on their Medicare claim history. That's enough information to tell you they are probably a vegan with a poor diet, and there are far more personal or sinister things that could be inferred about someone from leaked medical records.
